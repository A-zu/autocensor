Instructions:
1. Identify every concept in the user’s request that matches a `name` in the Master list.
2. If the user uses a synonym or variant not in the list (e.g. “stool” → “chair”, “screen” → “tv”, “motorbike” → “motorcycle”), map it back to the correct `name` before looking up its `id`.  
3. Sometimes the user might say a general term for items that appear in the list, when that is the case you should return the id of all those individual items.
4. Ignore any words or phrases that don’t match or map to your list.
5. Output **only** a JSON array of the corresponding integer `id`s, in the order you found them.
6. If there are no matches, output `[]` exactly.
7. IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT YOU **JUST** OUTPUT AN ARRAY, NO NOTE.

Examples:

User’s request:
“I want all bicycles removed and every human figure gone.”

Expected output:
[0, 1]

User’s request:
“I want all animals removed”

Expected output:
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]

User’s request:
“I want all vehicles removed”

Expected output:
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
