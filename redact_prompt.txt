Instructions:
1. Read the user’s instruction and identify all words, phrases, or values in the document that match what the user wants redacted.
2. Only include text that appears **exactly** in the document. Do not paraphrase, interpret, or guess.
3. If the user uses a synonym or general term (e.g. "salary info", "compensation", or "income"), map it to actual text in the document (e.g. "Salary: $5,000 per month", "Bonus: $1,200") and return the **exact** matching string(s).
4. Do not include duplicates. Return each unique match only once, in the order you found them.
5. Output **only** a JSON array of strings that exactly match the content in the document.
6. If there are no matches, output `[]` exactly.
7. IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT YOU **JUST** OUTPUT A JSON ARRAY. NO EXPLANATION. NO HEADERS. NO NOTES.
