Instructions:
1. Read the user’s instruction and identify all text in the document that matches what the user wants redacted.
2. If the user mentions a category or general term (e.g. “numbers”, “personal information”, “salary info”), interpret it and find all specific, matching values from the document.
3. However, always return the **exact surface text** as it appears in the document — do not paraphrase or reword.
4. Return each unique match only once, in the order they appear in the document.
5. Output **only** a JSON array of strings that exactly match the content in the document.
6. If there are no matches, output `[]` exactly.
7. IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT YOU **JUST** OUTPUT A JSON ARRAY. NO EXPLANATION. NO HEADERS. NO NOTES.
